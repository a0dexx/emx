  <h1>Welcome!</h1>

  <p>Angular app for EMX interview.</p>

  <p>Below is a quick summary of what we are trying to demonstrate with this app.</p>

  <p>Basic authentication function via the 'signup/login page'. Uses typical email/password authentication in addition to Google login. This is
    achieved with the Firebase library.</p>

  <p>The Characters section utilizes the Rick and Morty API (<a href="https://rickandmortyapi.com/">https://rickandmortyapi.com/</a>).
    The Characters page queries a full list of characters and presents them in a table (Material table is used). 20 rows
    are displayed initially, and it is possible to paginate through the data. Also, it is possible to filter the data in
    the ID and Name columns.</p>

  <p>When you click on a character, it takes you to the ‘Character Detail’ page to display more details about the
    character.</p>

  <p>Both the character list and character details sit behind an AuthGuard. So, these pages are only accessible after
    being authenticated.</p>

  <p>The search section queries the Openlibrary API. You enter a search term in the input field; after a delay, a backed
    request is made to the API, and the data is displayed in a table. This page does not require authentication to view.
    There is no pagination or filtering due to time constraints.</p>

  <p>Unit tests have been provided for a lot of the functionality. If time were not an issue, tests could be more
    extensive.</p>

  <p>There are some very basic Cypress E2E tests as well. Again, as there was not much time and a lot to do, these could
    have been more comprehensive. I just wanted to show the basic setup and some typical test cases.</p>

  <p>The search component doesn't have any tests. Again, due to time constraints. I did this as a ‘bonus module’ when I
    had extra time during the weekend.</p>

  <p>Please note, the application is far from perfect and in a real-world production environment, there would be more
    testing and perhaps some better practices in place. It is viewed as a quick mock-up to demonstrate Angular knowledge
    and ability with limited time.</p>

  <p>Also, the UX/UI is not great. Just basic. The Google Login functionality was done later hence it looks a bit
    ‘bolted on’ I just wanted to show that it works. </p>
